            <div id="content"><p>A late night while driving down an intersate, Smith had been driving for just under twelve hours so he decided to find a place to pull over and rest before resuming his journey the following morning. After about thirty minutes he came across a small unmarked town which was unassuming, just a gas station, a few fast food restaurants and a motel visible in the dead of night with their bright neon lights still lit, pulling over into the motel parking lot Smith got out of his vehicle and walked into the office to book a room.</p>
<p>"Need a room for one night, please" Smith would say to the receptionist, "And do you know when the restaurants open up 'round here?" </p>
<p>The bored receptionist looked annoyed at Smith's arrival "That'll be twenty dollars. Revelations opens at Six." She said with a hint of disgust in her voice as she tossed a key to Smith before going back to reading her book.</p>
<p>Smith looked confused at her attitude and the cheap room prices, he handed her a twenty dollar bill and took the key, heading out of the office and to the room sharing the same number on the key, room one-zero-seven, he made his way to his room and took in the place, it was seemingly ordinary, no mold, weird smell or anything else alarming, nothing pointing to the cheap price. Either from sleep deprivation or lack of care, Smith was lulled into a peace nights rest, setting an alarm for five o'clock the following morning, however when he woke up he looked at the clock and shocked to see only three hours had gone by, the clock read two twenty-four, far before his alarm was to go off however, the clock was blaring, when he shut it off and stumbled to his feet, he slipped on his shoes and went to the front office and found a different receptionist this time, "Hey, uhm- sorry to bother you, do you know what the date is today?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, as of today it is Thursday, March Seventeenth." She replied with a kind smile, while organizing from documents in a filing cabinet "Was there something else you needed help with?"</p>
<p>Smith looked at her as if she insulted his whole family, mouth agape trying to piece together how he had slept through an entire day "Sorry- what? March Seventeenth, how- how, how is that possible?" He said while almost tripping over his own foot as he turned around to look outside, his car was still sitting where he had parked it, signs from the nearby gas station and fast food restaurant still lit. </p>
<p>"Is everything alright, Mister Smith?" The receptionist asked politely, causing more confusion for Smith, how did she know his name? He never told anyone, didn't sign any paperwork, just handed the last receptionist a twenty and walked out. </p>
<p>"Y-yeah. Yeah, sorry. Have a goodnight, or.. Good morning i guess, ma'am" He replied while walking backwards to the door, opening it and slipping out, keeping his eyes on her before booking it to his room and grabbing his few belongings he had brought with him and turning to leave the place.</p>
<p>As he quickly exited the motel room with his items in hand he quickly noticed a crowd of people emerging from the street slowly creeping towards him, in no rush, no words, just a crowd of people walking towards him. Immediately alarmed Smith rushed to his car and jumped in, putting the key in the ignition and twisting, he immediately locked the doors and put the car into reverse, flooring it without a care if he hit someone, he made a quick getaway from the small town, rushing back onto the interstate well above the speed limit.<br />
It wasn't long before a highway patrol had turned on his lights and sirens and chased after Smith, pulling him over. Smith, looking like he had seen a ghost, tried to explain to the officer why he was speed.</p>
<p>"Sir, if you're going to lie, make it believeable. There's no town nearby, the closest one would be thirty miles that way-" The officer waves his hand east, the way Smith was speeding towards making it unlikely for him to be speeding out of a town</p>
<p>"Officer, please, maybe follow me to the town. There- there, there was a crowd of people walking towards me, i swear to god, please." He tried to explain himself but the Officer just let out a long sigh, writing him a citation and handing it to Smith</p>
<p>"Sure, sure. Here's your ticket. I'll behind you and if there is a town that sprung up from nowhere nearby as you claim, I'll take the ticket back." The officer walked back to his car, turning off his lights and following Smith as they make a U-Turn around and heading West now. Surely the town couldn't have been further than half a mile away but as they continued, mile marker after mile marker had went by, Smith was even more confused, making another U-Turn around after driving for near ten miles. After driving another ten miles back to where he was pulled over he shocked to not have seen the town he had visited, how could a town just disappear like that?</p></div>
