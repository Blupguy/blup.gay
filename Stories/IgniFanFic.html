    <p><i>A/N: i am my own character in this story btw ok plz enjoy lol 😎</i></p>

    <hr>

    <p>It was a <b><i>normal day</i></b> like any other normal day that was normal.</p>

    <p><b>Igni</b> had just uploaded the GREATEST video ever titled: 
    <i><u>"Platinuming K-9 Dog Job made me go to the psych ward"</u></i>. 💿🧠🐶</p>

    <p><i>A/N: don't worry he's FINE in this story ok??? 💕</i></p>

    <p>In the video he played the 2019 hit indie game <b>K-9 Dog Job</b> (NOT SPONSORED!!!) developed by <b>Easy Game™</b> and published by <b>Game For People™</b> (again not sponsored, just facts). 🐾🎮</p>

    <p>He got <b>ALL 100 ACHIEVEMENTS</b>. That's right. Even the forbidden one. Even the one no one else could even <i>dream</i> of touching. 😤🔥</p>

    <p>But then... </p>

    <p><b><i>YouTube</i></b> was like "nah." The algorithm smacked the video with a flag for <b>misinformation</b> and <b>AI-generated content</b>... HOW DARE??</p>

    <p><i>Igni is too strong to cheat. He is a gamer of LEGEND. 💪🕹️</i></p>

    <p>And then I—<b>Blup</b>—<i><u>BURST</u></i> through the bedroom door like a majestic wind of urgency. (He gave me a key, we’re tight like that.)</p>

    <p>“<i><b>IGNI KAEN.</b></i>” I screamed with passion and justice. “<i>They’re trying to TAKE IT DOWN!</i>”</p>

    <p>Igni stood slowly. The room got 30% more serious. The lighting changed. Synthwave played. </p>

    <p>“Blup... stand back.”</p>

    <p>Suddenly, from the floor rose a <b>RED BUTTON</b> on a golden pedestal, glowing with untamed bee power. 🐝✨</p>

    <p><i>"It’s time... for the Hit Bees."</i></p>

    <p>He SLAMMED the button. A klaxon screamed. Windows shattered (not really but kinda).</p>

</style>
    <p>A SWARM of bees in tuxedos and Ray-Bans flew out the window at <b>Mach Bee Speed™</b>, heading straight to <b>Youtube HQ</b> (which, as we all know, is located in downtown Dallas, Texas 75202 across from the JFK memorial plaza 🗺️💀).</p>

    <p>Inside HQ, chaos. Workers screamed. Alarms blared. Bees did parkour. One bee suplexed a server tower. Another slapped a latte out of someone’s hand. Justice was happening. </p>

    <p>The bees flew to the ex-CEO herself, <b>Susan “Still Got An Office” Wojcicki</b>. She turned slowly. “I’ve been expecting you.”</p>

    <p>With one final STING OF RIGHTEOUSNESS™, the flags on Igni’s video vanished. ✨🎯</p>

    <p>Igni... was vindicated. He nodded once. “Good bees.” Then took a nap. Like a king. 👑</p>

    <center><b>✨ THE END ✨</b></center>

    <p><i>A/N: thx for reading... remember to always respect bees and gamers 🐝🎮💖</i></p>
