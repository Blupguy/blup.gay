<p>One will leaf here alive. </p>
<p>The other will be forgotten to the annals of history. </p>
<p>They leap towards one another, aiming their mandibles at their opponents jugular.</p>
<p><strong>"You've left me no choice, Sir Antony, if you will not call off your army.</strong> <br />
<strong>I summon thee: Bird of Light, </strong><br />
<strong>clear as day,</strong><br />
<strong>hear my roar,</strong><br />
<strong>my opponent you shall slay!"</strong><br />
One ant chants out-</p>
<p>Suddenly, a flicker of the sun, a shadow growing in size as a giant, fluffy brown Wren swoops down, crashing through the leaf and eating the opposing ant, leave the one.</p></div>
